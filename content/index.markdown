# Research Interests

My research interests include programming languages, persistent memory (NVM),
dynamic program analysis, and data race detection.

I am currently working on novel methods for providing efficient persistent
transactions with strong guarantees. Our work uses non-volatile memory, such as
Intel Optane Memory, combined with commodity hardware transactional memory to
allow programs to survive power interruptions and crashes, with minimal
performance and scalability impacts.

# Teaching Experience

During Autumn 2017 and Spring 2018 semesters, I had the opportunity to teach the
class [CSE
2451](http://coe-portal.cse.ohio-state.edu/pdf-exports/CSE/CSE-2451.pdf),
Advanced C Programming, at the Ohio State Univerity. The class had around 35
students enrolled for both semesters. I was given the full responsibilities for
the class, including teaching the class, writing assignments and exams, grading,
and holding office hours. I revised the course material I was given, making it
more comprehensive and adding unique insights on building and optimizing
advanced C programs.

The students were satisfied with my teaching, with my Student Evaluation of
Instruction mean scores being 4.6 and 4.4 out of 5 for both semesters, a score
above the university mean for classes of similar size.
